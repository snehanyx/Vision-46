# 👁️ VISION-46 – AI-Based Object Detection & Navigation Web App

VISION-46 is a browser-based assistive system for real-time **object detection**, **text reading**, and **voice-guided navigation**, built using JavaScript, TensorFlow.js, and Tesseract.js.

---

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects objects live using webcam and **COCO-SSD**
- Reads printed text via **OCR (Tesseract.js)**
- Voice-assisted **navigation** using Google Maps
- **Speech recognition** for hands-free input
